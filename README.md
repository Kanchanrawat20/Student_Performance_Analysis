🎓 Student Performance Analysis 
This project analyzes student academic performance data to identify key factors that influence grades. Using Python, various data preprocessing and machine learning techniques were applied to explore, visualize, and predict student performance.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for EDA)
Scikit-learn
XGBoost

🧩 Steps Involved
1. Data Collection
Used a real-world dataset related to student academic records.

3. Data Cleaning
Handled missing values
Removed duplicates
Corrected data inconsistencies

4. Data Preprocessing
Label Encoding for categorical variables
Feature Scaling
Dimensionality Reduction using PCA

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis
Bivariate Analysis
Multivariate Analysis
Correlation & Covariance Heatmaps

6. Model Building
Applied Linear Regression & XGBoost
Used Gradient Descent for optimization
Evaluated models using RMSE, MSE, R², Confusion Matrix

7. Cross Validation & Regularization
Implemented k-Fold Cross Validation
Regularized models to prevent overfitting
